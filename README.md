echo "# Gram-Schmidt 3D Visualization

This project visualizes the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process in 3D using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## How to Run

Make sure you have NumPy and Matplotlib installed:

\`\`\`bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
\`\`\`

Then run:

\`\`\`bash
python gram_schmidt_plot.py
\`\`\`

## Output

The script will display a 3D plot showing both the original and orthonormalized vectors.
